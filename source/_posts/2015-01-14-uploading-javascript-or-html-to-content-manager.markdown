Step by step of uploading your Javascript or HTML files to the Scala Content Manager.
<!--more-->

To upload files like Javascript or HTML to the Scala Content Mangar you must create a widget. To do this your must put all your files into one folder as such

<img src="{{ root_url }}/images/widget/widget.jpg"/>

Once these files are all under the main folder you can then compress that folder, this creates a <span style="italics">.zip</span> file. Change the file extension to <span style="italics">.wgt</span>. Once this is done you can upload your widget to the Scala Content Manager.

This file can then be uploaded to a player like an Intel Nook.

Keep on being bad ass!
